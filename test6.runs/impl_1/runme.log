WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 hit_pixel/FontRom/fontRow_reg has an input control pin hit_pixel/FontRom/fontRow_reg/ADDRARDADDR[12] (net: hit_pixel/FontRom/ADDRARDADDR[8]) which is driven by a register (vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg_reg[4]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
